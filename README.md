📌 Simple Educational Keylogger

A simple Python-based keylogging program created purely for educational and learning purposes.
The tool demonstrates how keystrokes can be captured using Python’s keyboard event listeners.

This project does NOT run in the background, does NOT hide itself, and works only while the script is active.
It is meant for learning keyboard events, file operations, and Python basics.

⭐ Why This Project?

To understand how keyboard event listeners work

To learn file writing in Python

To explore small real-time input tracking programs

To practice a beginner-level Python script

This is not a malicious keylogger — it is a safe, controlled educational project.

⭐ Features

Records keys pressed during program execution

Saves the keystrokes to a log file (keylog.txt)

Simple and easy to understand code

Works only in foreground while running

Helps beginners learn input events and file handling
